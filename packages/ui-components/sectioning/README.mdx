# Sectioning

Sectioning components are React [Components] that wrap [sectioning content].
Sectioning represents a thematically similar section of content,
and establishes or participates in an HTML5 [document outline],
or heading level (h1, h2, etc) hierarchy.

For a good overview of using HTML5 semantics to section content
(and the many pitfalls), see:

- [How to Section your HTML]
- [Why You Should Choose HTML5 `article` Over `section`]
- [A Decade of Heading Backwards]

## Rationale

One common piece of advice amongst devs who've read the [spec] is to
'just use `<h1>` everywhere'. The spec even says it:

> â€¦authors are strongly encouraged to either use only h1 elements,
> or to use elements of the appropriate rank for the section's nesting level.

However, in practice, [there is no document outline algorithm]. So,
it turns out that using "elements of the appropriate rank for
the section's nesting level" is the _only viable option_.

You may be wondering, given the above, why would you want to use
a set of components that purports to conform to that spec?

**The short answer**: Rendering a specific heading level (e.g., `<h2>`)
implicitly _couples_ a component to a page structure, which limits
composability and reuse, and these components let you break that coupling.

**The longer answer**:

Composition is a core feature of React, and a component that renders
a heading level element is inherently _less_ composable than one
that does not, since the browser (or assistive technology) _will not_
apply document outline semantics to 'fix' your heading levels for you.

An `<h2>` in the wrong place (say, after an `<h3>`) could be confusing
for assistive technologies and search engines, and explicitly rendering
`<h2>` or `<h3>` in your components makes it very easy to uknowingly
create this problem.

Instead, you could use the sectioning [H] component anywhere where you
might otherwise use an `<h1>` (or `<h2>`, or `<h3>`...). This way, when
you compose your component with other, more general components
(using [Sectioning components]), the rendered elements will
_automatically_ be "the appropriate rank for the section's nesting level"!

In other words, these sectioning components let you write code as if
the document outline was a thing, even though it's not.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/sectioning
```

## Usage

```jsx
import {Body, Section, Article, Blockquote, H} from '@hzdg/sectioning';
```

<Playground>
  <Body>
    <H>This H renders an h1 in a Body sectioning root context</H>
    <Section>
      <H>This H renders an h2 in a Section sectioning content context</H>
      <Article>
        <H>
          This H renders an h3 in a nested Article sectioning content context
        </H>
        <Blockquote>
          <H>
            This H renders an h1 in a nested Blockquote sectioning root context
          </H>
        </Blockquote>
        <H level={4}>
          This H renders an h4 override (would be h3) in a nested Article
          sectioning content context
        </H>
      </Article>
    </Section>
  </Body>
</Playground>

## Sectioning Components

The [sectioning content] components increase the [heading level] for their
descendants by one for each level of nesting, from 2 to 6.

The sectioning content components are:

- `Article`
- `Aside`
- `Nav`
- `Section`

These components can be used in place of their intrinsic counterparts,
e.g. `<article>`, `<section>`, etc. They will render the corresponding
element (with all props, attributes, ref, etc.), but also wrap the children
in a [Section Level Context].

### Sectioning Root Components

In contrast to the components above, [sectioning root] components _reset_
the heading level to 1 for their descendants, _regardless_ of the heading level
in which they may be nested.

The sectioning root components are:

- `Body`
- `Blockquote`
- `Details`
- `Dialog`
- `Fieldset`
- `Figure`
- `Td`

> **NOTE:** The document outline [spec] has **never been implemented**
> by any major web browser or assistive technology. This means that
> these sectioning root components may confound [heading level] expectations
> in browsers and screen readers, so use them with caution!

## H

A component that renders a [heading level] element. It is used like intrinsic
`<h1>`, `<h2>` , etc, but the level is _automatically_ determined by its context.

See [Sectioning Components] for more.

```jsx
import {H} from '@hzdg/sectioning';
```

<Playground>
  <H>This H renders an h1 with no sectioning context</H>
</Playground>

### With a `level` prop

<Playground>
  <H level={2}>
    This H renders an h2 override (would be h1) with no sectioning context
  </H>
</Playground>

## Section Level Context

These are not normally used directly (use the [Sectioning Components] and [H]
instead), and are mostly an implementation detail, but the context provider
and hook are exported for convenience and completeness.

### SectionLevelProvider

A React [context] provider that establishes a sectioning context for
descendant sectioning and heading content.

```jsx
import {SectionLevelProvider} from '@hzdg/sectioning';

function CustomSectioningRootComponent({children, ...props}) {
  return (
    <div {...props}>
      <SectionLevelProvider value={1}>{children}</SectionLevelProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useSectionLevel

A React [hook] that returns the current sectioning level, as provided by
the nearest [SectionLevelProvider].

```jsx
import {useSectionLevel} from '@hzdg/sectioning';
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    function SectionLevelUser() {
      const level = useSectionLevel();
      return <H>the current section level is {level}</H>;
    }
    return <SectionLevelUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

### useNextSectionLevel

A React [hook] that returns the current sectioning level, incremented by 1,
up to the maximum level of 6, as provided by the nearest [SectionLevelProvider].

Note that, as the minimum section level is 1, the default
return value will be 2 when no sectioning context has been established.

```jsx
import {useNextSectionLevel} from '@hzdg/sectioning';
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    function NextSectionLevelUser() {
      const level = useNextSectionLevel();
      return (
        <React.Fragment>
          <H>This section's level is {level - 1} (one less than the next).</H>
          <Section>
            <H>This nested section's level matches {level}</H>
          </Section>
        </React.Fragment>
      );
    }
    return <NextSectionLevelUser />;
  }}
</Playground>
