# FocusScope

A React [component] for managing focus.

## Motivation

As a platform, the web is woefully underspecified when it comes to many common
UI patterns. In the sense that there is a platform to use, it's not possible
to simply "use the platform" for sufficiently complex UIs (which includes
_most_ UIs). The extent of this problem is well illustrated by perusing the
W3C guide for WAI-ARIA [Authoring Practices].

There is an _overwhelming_ amount of detail and consideration that
goes into building the UI components outlined in that document,
which is made even more daunting when considering just how _often_
at least one of these components is designed for!

That's a lot of talk to say that building UIs for the web is _hard_.
`FocusScope` is a component designed to simplify one basic,
but far-reaching and complex aspect of building web UIs: **managing focus**.

Some of the common use cases that `FocusScope` can help with include:

- [trapping focus]
- [focusing automatically]
- [restoring focus]
- [managing focus with events]
- [nesting focus scopes]

`FocusScope` is also designed for any general-purpose focus management
when used [as a headless component].

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/focus-scope
```

## Usage

```js
import FocusScope from '@hzdg/focus-scope';
```

`FocusScope` can be used in two ways; [as a container], or [as a headless component].

### As a Container

The most straightfoward way to use `FocusScope` is as a container for one or
more other elements:

```jsx
const SomeComponent = () => (
  <FocusScope>
    <input {...} />
    <button {...} />
  </FocusScope>
)
```

In the above example, `FocusScope` renders a `<span>` element,
and renders its children as children of the span.

The container element can be configured by setting the `as` prop:

```jsx
const SomeComponent = () => (
  <FocusScope as="form">
    <input {...} />
    <button {...} />
  </FocusScope>
)
```

The `as` prop is not limited to intrinsic [ReactDOM] elements like `span`
or `form`, though. Any [ref-forwarding component] may be used:

```jsx
const SomeRefForwardingComponent = React.forwardRef(
  ({someAdditionalProp, children}, forwardedRef) => (
    <div ref={forwardedRef}>
      <span>{someAdditionalProp}<span>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
);
const SomeComponent = () => (
  <FocusScope as={SomeRefForwardingComponent} someAdditionalProp="foo">
    <input {...} />
    <button {...} />
  </FocusScope>
)
```

In the above example, `FocusScope` renders `SomeRefForwardingComponent`
with its children and any additional props.

A common use case for the `as` prop is with a [styled component]:

```jsx
const StyledForm = styled.form`
  background: hotpink;
`;
const SomeComponent = () => (
  <FocusScope as={StyledForm}>
    <input {...} />
    <button {...} />
  </FocusScope>
)
```

> Note that `FocusScope` passes a [ref] to `SomeRefForwardingComponent`,
> which is why the `as` element type must be a [ReactDOM] element type or
> [ref-forwarding component].

### As a Headless Component

Out of the box, `FocusScope` comes with some nice in-built behaviors
and abilities, like trapping focus, reacting to focus and blur changes,
or handling keyboard inputs. Sometimes, though, a UI has more specific
focus-bound behaviors that require more precise control.

`FocusScope` may be used as a [headless component] when implementing
more low-level focus-bound behaviors by passing a **function as children**,
otherwise known as a [render prop]:

```jsx
const SomeComponent = () => (
  // Note that features that depend on bindings to a DOM element,
  // like `trap`, or focus and keyboard bindings, won't work
  // when using the render prop. However, features that work
  // independently of a particular DOM element,
  // like `autoFocus` and `restoreFocus`, will.
  <FocusScope id="someid" autoFocus restoreFocus>
    {({ref, focusManager}) => {
      // Specific focus-bound behaviors can be implemented
      // using the provided `focusManager`.
      // Be sure to forward the provided `ref` to a DOM element!
      return (
        <form ref={ref}>
          <input {...} />
          <button {...} />
        </form>
      )
    }}
    </FocusScope>
);
```

The render prop receives a `ref` callback which **must be** passed as a ref
to a [ReactDOM] element. It also receives the [FocusManager] instance
for this `FocusScope`. It is expected to return a valid React Node,
just like any function component:

```typescript
(props: {ref: (element: Element) => void; focusManager: FocusManager}) =>
  JSX.Element;
```

> Using `FocusScope` in a headless manner comes with some important caveats:
>
> - Your [render prop] function will be passed an object parameter that includes
>   a `ref` callback. This ref should be forwarded to a ReactDOM element.
> - Behaviors of `FocusScope` that depend on binding to a DOM element
>   **will not work**, namely:
>   - Trapping focus via the [trap] prop
>   - Handling focus events via the [onFocus] prop
>   - Handling blur events via the [onBlur] prop
>   - Handling keyboard events via the [onKeyPress] prop
>
> These behaviors (or any other focus-bound behaviors) can be implemented
> by the render prop component via the provided `FocusManager` instance.
>
> However, features of `FocusScope` that don't require binding to DOM element,
> such as [autoFocus] and [restoreFocus], will still work.

## Props

### id

```typescript
id?: string | null;
```

An optional string to identify the [FocusManager] for this `FocusScope`.

Note that ids must be unique per focus tree.

### as

```typescript
as?: React.ElementType;
```

The React element type to render. Defaults to `'span'`.
If the provided value is not a [ReactDOM] component,
it should forward the provided ref to an underlying
component.
See https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html

### trap

```typescript
trap?: boolean;
```

Whether or not to 'trap' focus within this `FocusScope`.

If `true`, then once focus is within this scope, it will be retained,
even when a blur occurs. Additionally, changing focus (i.e.,
via tab key press) will cycle through the focusable elements
within this scope.

Defaults to `false`.

For more, see [Trapping Focus].

### autoFocus

```typescript
autoFocus?: boolean;
```

Whether or not to focus on the first focusable element
in this scope when this `FocusScope` mounts.

If this is toggled to `true` after mount, it will have no effect.

Defaults to `false`.

For more, see [Focusing Automatically].

### restoreFocus

```typescript
restoreFocus?: boolean;
```

Whether or not to restore focus to the previously focused element
when this `FocusScope` unmounts.

Defaults to `false`.

For more, see [Restoring Focus].

### onFocus

```typescript
onFocus?: (event: FocusEvent, focusManager: FocusManager) => void;
```

Optional handler for when focus enters this scope.

Receives the `FocusEvent` and the associated `FocusManager` instance
for the enclosing `FocusScope`, which is useful for manually updating
focus in response to the event.

### onBlur

```typescript
onBlur?: (event: FocusEvent, focusManager: FocusManager) => void;
```

Optional handler for when focus leaves this scope.

Receives the `FocusEvent` and the associated `FocusManager` instance
for the enclosing `FocusScope`, which is useful for manually updating
focus in response to the event.

### onKeyPress

```typescript
onKeyPress?: (event: KeyboardEvent, focusManager: FocusManager) => void;
```

Optional handler for when _any_ keypress occurs within scope.

Receives the `KeyboardEvent` and the associated `FocusManager` instance
for the enclosing `FocusScope`, which is useful for manually updating
focus in response to the event.

For more, see [Managing Focus with Events].

## FocusManager

The `FocusManager` is both a utility for managing focus within a `FocusScope`
and a data structure for representing focus hierarchy.

`FocusScope` works by creating a hierarchy of `FocusManager` instances that
correspond to the relationship of `FocusScope` nodes in the React element tree.
This means that every `FocusScope` has a corresponding `FocusManager` instance,
and if a `FocusScope` is a descendant of another `FocusScope`, then its
`FocusManager` instance will be a child of the other's `FocusManager`.

There are two basic ways to get access to the `FocusManager` instance:

- The instance is passed to the callback props [onFocus], [onBlur],
  and [onKeyPress].
- The instance is passed to the render prop function when `FocusScope`
  is used [as a headless component].

The `FocusManager` instance exposes the the following properties and methods:

### id

```typescript
get id(): string | null;
```

An optional string id for the `FocusManager`. This value
corresponds to the `id` prop passed to the matching `FocusScope`.

Useful for being able to find this `FocusManager` via [findManagerById].

### root

```typescript
get root(): FocusManager;
```

The root `FocusManager` that this `FocusManager` is a descendant of.

Note that the root `FocusManager` will be for the document,
even though no `FocusScope` is explicitly created for the document.

### parent

```typescript
get parent(): FocusManager | null;
```

The parent `FocusManager` that this `FocusManager` is a child of.

### getChildManagers

```typescript
getChildManagers(): FocusManager[];
```

Get an array of child `FocusManager` instances.

### hasChildManagers

```typescript
hasChildManagers(): boolean;
```

Whether this `FocusManager` has at least one child `FocusManager`.

### findClosestManager

```typescript
findClosestManager(
  /**
    * An element that may be a descendant of this `FocusManager` element,
    * or of descendant `FocusManager` elements.
    */
  element: Element,
): FocusManager | null;
```

Traverse _up_ the DOM tree, starting at the given element.
For each visited DOM element, traverse the `FocusManager` hierarchy
to find a `FocusManager` for the visited DOM element.

Returns the `FocusManager` for the ancestor DOM element
_closest_ to the given element, or `null`.

### findManager

```typescript
findManager(
  /**
    * An element that might correspond to this `FocusManager`
    * or a descendant `FocusManager`.
    */
  element: Element,
): FocusManager | null;
```

Traverse the `FocusManager` hierarchy to find
a descendant `FocusManager` for the given `element`, or `null`.

### findManagerById

```typescript
findManagerById(
  /**
    * An id that might correspond to this `FocusManager`
    * or a descendant `FocusManager`.
    */
  id: string,
): FocusManager | null;
```

Traverse the `FocusManager` hierarchy to find
a `FocusManager` for the given `id`.

If no `FocusManager` is found, then traverse again from the root.

If no `FocusManager` is found after traversing from the root,
`null` is returned.

### getFocusedElementGlobal

```typescript
getFocusedElementGlobal(): Element | null;
```

Get the currently focused element,
even if it is outside of the scope of this `FocusManager`.

### getFocusedElement

```typescript
getFocusedElement(
  /**
    * If true, then an element in a nested scope
    * will also be considered in this scope.
    */
  includeNested?: boolean,
): Element | null;
```

Get the focused element in the `FocusManager` scope, or `null`.

An element is in scope if it is:

- focusable
- a descendant of the `FocusManager` element
- not a descendant of any nested `FocusManager` element
  _or_ `includeNested` is `true`

### containsFocusableElements

```typescript
containsFocusableElements(
  /**
    * If true, then an element in a nested scope
    * will also be considered in this scope.
    */
  includeNested?: boolean,
  /** If `true`, check for _tabbable_ elements instead. */
  tabbable?: boolean,
): boolean;
```

Check whether this `FocusManager` has _any_ focusable elements
within its scope.

An element is in scope if it is:

- focusable
- a descendant of the `FocusManager` element
- not a descendant of any nested `FocusManager` element
  _or_ `includeNested` is `true`

### containsFocusableElement

```typescript
containsFocusableElement(
  /** An element that may be in this `FocusManager` scope. */
  element: Element,
  /**
    * If `true`, then an element in a nested scope
    * will also be considered in this scope.
    */
  includeNested?: boolean,
  /** If `true`, check that the element is in scope _and tabbable_. */
  tabbable?: boolean,
): boolean;
```

Check whether this `FocusManager` has the given element within its scope.

An element is in scope if it is:

- focusable
- a descendant of the `FocusManager` element
- not a descendant of any nested `FocusManager` element
  _or_ `includeNested` is `true`

### focusFirst

```typescript
focusFirst(
  /**
   * Either an optional boolean indicating whether to focus
   * the first _tabbable_ element instead, or an optional object
   * for controlling aspects of the focusing process.
   */
  tabbableOrOptions?: boolean | (FocusOptions & {tabbable?: boolean}),
): Element | null;
```

Focus the first focusable element in the _deep_ `FocusManager` scope,
or if `tabbable` is `true`, the first tabbable element in the scope.

Accepts either a `tabbable` boolean, or a [focus options] object
that may include a `tabbable` boolean field. See [focus] for
more on focus options.

An element is in the _deep_ scope if it is:

- focusable
- a descendant of the `FocusManager` element
- a descendant of any nested `FocusManager` element.

### focusLast

```typescript
focusLast(
  /**
   * Either an optional boolean indicating whether to focus
   * the last _tabbable_ element instead, or an optional object
   * for controlling aspects of the focusing process.
   */
  tabbableOrOptions?: boolean | (FocusOptions & {tabbable?: boolean}),
): Element | null;
```

Focus the last focusable element in the _deep_ `FocusManager` scope,
or if `tabbable` is `true`, the last tabbable element in the scope.

  /** The element to focus. */
  target: Element,
  /** Optional options for controlling aspects of the focusing process. */
  options?: FocusOptions,
): Element | null;
```

focusPrevious(
  /**
   * Either an optional boolean indicating whether to focus
   * the previous _tabbable_ element instead, or an optional object
   * for controlling aspects of the focusing process.
   */
  tabbableOrOptions?: boolean | (FocusOptions & {tabbable?: boolean}),
): Element | null;
```

Focus the previous focusable element relative to
the currently focused element in the _deep_ `FocusManager` scope,
or if `tabbable` is `true`, the previous tabbable element
relative to the currently focused element in scope.

- focusable
- a descendant of the `FocusManager` element
- a descendant of any nested `FocusManager` element.

## Trapping Focus

In many UI patterns, it is necessary to carefully implement keyboard
navigation and focus management to maintain acceptable levels of usability
and accessibility. One common example is the [Modal]. This type of UI pattern
is so common that there is a name for the implementation: the _focus trap_.

The focus trap:

- manages keyboard navigation that occurs when focus is within its scope
- 'loops' focus back to the first (or last) focusable element in scope
- recaptures focus to its scope when focus moves to an out-of-scope element

`FocusScope` solves for this common pattern via the [trap] prop:

<Playground>
  <FocusScopeExample>
    <FocusScope trap>
      <div tabIndex={0}>You can tab to this</div>
      <div tabIndex={-1}>You can't tab to this cuz it has tab-index -1</div>
      <div tabIndex={0}>YOU CANNOT ESCAPE!</div>
      <Deactivate />
    </FocusScope>
  </FocusScopeExample>
</Playground>

> NOTE: Focus traps don't work
> when using `FocusScope` [as a headless component].

Focus traps created using `FocusScope` are nestable.
See [Nesting Focus Scopes] for more.

## Focusing Automatically

Occasionally UI patterns benefit from automatically focusing the first
focusable element when they appear. For example, a UI that reveals a
search input when the 'search' button is activated could automatically
move focus from the button to the input on reveal.

For use cases like this, `FocusScope` has an [autoFocus] feature:

<Playground>
  <FocusScopeExample>
    <FocusScope autoFocus>
      <div tabIndex={0}>this should be automatically focused</div>
      <Deactivate />
    </FocusScope>
  </FocusScopeExample>
</Playground>

> NOTE: `autoFocus` is generally considered detrimental to accessibility.
> Be sure that it is not likely to cause confusion for someone using a
> keyboard or screen reader before implementing!

## Restoring Focus

Some UI patterns include focusable elements that are temporarily reavealed,
(and that may even automatically receive focus on reveal via [autoFocus])
with the expectation that when the temporary elements are hidden, focus will
return to the previously focused element. For example, a [Combo box] may
reveal a list of options when activated, allowing the user to focus on items
in the list, and then restoring focus to the Combo box when a selection
is made or canceled.

For scenarios such as this, `FocusScope` includes a [restoreFocus] feature:

<Playground>
  <FocusScopeExample>
    <FocusScope restoreFocus>
      <div tabIndex={0}>You can tab to this</div>
      <Deactivate />
    </FocusScope>
  </FocusScopeExample>
</Playground>

## Managing Focus with Events

Sometimes focus needs to be manipulated in response to keyboard events.
For example, a [Carousel] may move focus to next and previous items
in the carousel in response to arrow key presses.

For scenarios such as these, `FocusScope` supports handling keyboard
events via [onkeyPress]:

<Playground>
  <FocusScopeExample>
    <FocusScope
      autoFocus
      onKeyPress={(event, focusManager) => {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowDown') {
          focusManager.focusNext();
          event.preventDefault();
        } else if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
          focusManager.focusPrevious();
          event.preventDefault();
        }
      }}
    >
      <div tabIndex={-1}>You can't tab to these</div>
      <div tabIndex={-1}>Use arrow keys</div>
      <div tabIndex={-1}>instead</div>
      <Deactivate />
    </FocusScope>

  </FocusScopeExample>
</Playground>

## Nesting Focus Scopes

While `FocusScope` is designed to manage arbitrarily deeply nested focusable
elements within its scope, it is also designed to coordinate with
other `FocusScope` components that are nested. For example, a Modal that
traps focus, might include a Combo box that _also_ traps focus when it is
active.

`FocusScope` supports nested `FocusScopes` by delegating management of
focus to the nested scopes when appropriate:

<Playground>
  <FocusScopeExample>
    <FocusScope trap>
      <div tabIndex={0}>This is a trap</div>
      <FocusScopeExample>
        <FocusScope trap>
          <div tabIndex={0}>This is a trap too</div>
          <Deactivate />
        </FocusScope>
      </FocusScopeExample>
      <Deactivate />
    </FocusScope>
  </FocusScopeExample>
</Playground>
