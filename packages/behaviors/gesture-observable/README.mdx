# GestureObservable

An [Observable] for gestures.

Uses the [zen-observable] implementation of Observable.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/gesture-observable
```

## Usage

```js
import GestureObservable from '@hzdg/gesture-observable';
```

Create an observable by passing the element
you wish to observe and gesture configuration to `GestureObservable.create`:

```js
const element = document.getElementById('some-element-that-receives-gestures');
const observable = GestureObservable.create(element, {
  keyboard: boolean;
  mouse: boolean;
  touch: boolean;
  wheel: boolean;
});
```

Then subscribe to it to receive an updated gesture state
whenever a gesture is detected:

```js
const subscription = observable.subscribe(gestureState => {
  // do something with the gesture state!
});
```

Then, whenever you are done watching the element, simply unsubscribe:

```js
//...sometime later
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

## Configuration

By default, `GestureObservable` is configured to use all supported sources.
That is to say, the default configuration looks like:

```js
{
  touch: true,
  mouse: true,
  wheel: true,
  keyboard: true,
  passive: false,
  preventDefault: false,
}
```

> **NOTE:** A `GestureObservable` configuration shape is
> the merger of the configuration of enabled inputs,
> **plus** the shapes of the configurations for the enabled inputs.
>
> For more, see:
>
> - [Configuration for Touch](#configuration-for-a-touchgestureobservable)
> - [Configuration for Mouse](#configuration-for-a-mousegestureobservable)
> - [Configuration for Wheel](#configuration-for-a-wheelgestureobservable)
> - [Configuration for Keyboard](#configuration-for-a-keyboardgestureobservable)

If you want to use all supported sources, but customize the configuration
for how they listen to events, you can specify just those parts of the config:

```js
// Use all the default inputs, but listen to them passively.
// Also treat _any_ wheel input as part of a gesture.
const observable = GestureObservable.create(someElement, {
  passive: true,
  threshold: false,
});
```

If you only want to use some of the supported sources, you have two options:

### Configuring `GestureObservable` to use just the sources you want

```js
// Use just mouse and touch support.
const observable = GestureObservable.create(someElement, {
  mouse: true,
  touch: true,
});
```

> **NOTE:** If you specify _any_ sources as `true`,
> then all unspecified sources will become `false`!

### Using one of the bundled single-source Observables

```js
import {
  MouseGestureObservable,
  TouchGestureObservable,
} from '@hzdg/gesture-observable';
// Use just mouse and touch support, but as separate observables.
// You might use some rx-style combinators to merge these,
// or subscribe to them individually.
const mouseObservable = MouseGestureObservable.create(someElement);
const touchObservable = TouchGestureObservable.create(someElement);
```

For more on using single-source Observables, see:

- [MouseGestureObservable](#mousegestureobservable)
- [TouchGestureObservable](#touchgestureobservable)
- [WheelGestureObservable](#wheelgestureobservable)
- [KeyboardGestureObservable](#keyboardgestureobservable)

## Handling Gesture State

When you subscribe, your subscriber will receive a series of objects over time
that represent the latest state of a previous or ongoing gesture. The exact
shape of this object will vary depending on your configuration.

For example, if you have a configuration like:

```js
// Use just keyboard and touch.
const observable = GestureObservable.create(someElement, {
  touch: true,
  keyboard: true,
});
```

Your subscriber will receive gesture state objects that reflect
either a snapshot of a touch gesture or a keyboard gesture,
depending on which input has most recently been indicated.

For more on gesture state, see the specifics for each source:

- [Mouse Gesture State](#mouse-gesture-state)
- [Touch Gesture State](#touch-gesture-state)
- [Wheel Gesture State](#wheel-gesture-state)
- [Keyboard Gesture State](#keyboard-gesture-state)

## TouchGestureObservable

   */
  preventDefault: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether or not to listen to touch events passively.
   * If `true`, then `preventDefault` will have no effect.
   */
  passive: boolean;
  /**
   * How 'far' a series of touch events must cumulatively move
   * in a consistent direction before a touch gesture is detected,
   * or `false`, if _any_ touch event should be considered part of a gesture.
   */
  threshold?: number | false;
  /**
   * The orientation in which a series of touch events
   * can move in order to be considered part of a gesture.

   * can be considered part of a gesture.
   */

### Mouse Gesture State

  type: 'mouseup';
}
```

## WheelGestureObservable

An Observable of a wheel gestures.

Uses normalized versions of wheel event values because they
can vary significantly on different platforms and browsers.
For example, some devices (like trackpads) emit more events
at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit
massive jumps with linear speed or acceleration.

Also uses a `gestureend` event to indicate when the intent
to end a wheel gesture has been detected. This is useful
because there is no native representation of a 'wheelend' event
(like you get from touch with 'touchend' or mouse with 'mouseup'),
which makes it difficult to decide when to resolve a guess
for a gesturing user's intention.

### Creating a WheelGestureObservable

```ts
import {WheelGestureObservable} from '@hzdg/gesture-observable';

const observable: Observable<
  WheelGestureState | WheelGestureEndState
> = WheelGestureObservable.create(
  /** The DOM element to observe for wheel events. */
  element: Element,
  /** Configuration for the WheelGestureObservable. */
  config?: Partial<WheelGestureObservableConfig> | null,
)
```

### Configuration for a WheelGestureObservable

```ts
interface WheelGestureObservableConfig {
  /**
   * Whether or not to prevent the default action
   * for `wheel` events during a gesture.
   */
  preventDefault: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether or not to listen to wheel events passively.
   * If `true`, then `preventDefault` will have no effect.
   */
  passive: boolean;
  /**
   * How 'far' a series of wheel events must cumulatively move
   * in a consistent direction before a wheel gesture is detected,
   * or `false`, if _any_ wheel event should be considered part of a gesture.
   */
  threshold?: number | false;
  /**
   * The orientation in which a series of wheel events
   * can move in order to be considered part of a gesture.
   * If not provided, then wheel events in _any_ orientation
   * can be considered part of a gesture.
