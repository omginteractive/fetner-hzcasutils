# useKeyPress

A React [hook] for components that care about keyboard input.

This hook lets you easily bind keyboard events to any React component.
You can update state, animate elements, etc. by using the data passed
to your handlers.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/use-key-press
```

## Usage

`useKeyPress` accepts [handlers] or [named handlers],
along with optional [config]. It returns a [bind] callback
that can either be used as props for [Binding to a React Element],
or used as an effect for [Binding to a DOM Element].

The most basic usage looks like:

```js
import useKeyPress from '@hzdg/use-key-press';

function SomeKeyPressUser() {
  const bind = useKeyPress(state => {
    /** Do something when any key is pressed, repeated, or released */
  });
  return <div {...bind()} tabIndex={0} />;
}
```

## Example

Below is a simple example using [react-spring] to transform
the offset and scale of an element based on arrow key presses:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [focused, setFocus] = React.useState(false);
    const [{x, y}, set] = useSpring(() => ({x: 0, y: 0}));
    const bind = useKeyPress({
      onArrowUp({event, down, repeat}) {
        event.preventDefault();
        set({y: down ? -repeat - 1 : 0});
      },
      onArrowDown({event, down, repeat}) {
        event.preventDefault();
        set({y: down ? repeat + 1 : 0});
      },
      onArrowLeft({event, down, repeat}) {
        event.preventDefault();
        set({x: down ? -repeat - 1 : 0});
      },
      onArrowRight({event, down, repeat}) {
        event.preventDefault();
        set({x: down ? repeat + 1 : 0});
      },
    });
    return (
      <div
        {...bind()}
        tabIndex={0}
        onFocus={() => setFocus(true)}
        onBlur={() => setFocus(false)}
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          flexDirection: 'column',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          height: 375,
        }}
      >
        <span>{focused ? 'press the arrow keys!' : 'focus me!'}</span>
        <animated.div
          style={{
            width: 40,
            height: 40,
            background: focused ? 'red' : 'pink',
            transform: interpolate(
              [x, y],
              (x, y) => `
            scale(${1 + Math.hypot(x, y) / 10})
            translate(${x * 10}px, ${y * 10}px)
          `,
            ),
          }}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Handlers

`useKeyPress` has only one required argument: a handler,
or a map of _at least one_ named handler. A handler is function
that will be passed the key press [state] whenever it changes, or
whenever the state matches the conditions described for the supported
[named handlers].

To handle any key event, pass a handler:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress(state => {
  /* do something with key press state */
});
```

However, it is rare that you care about _every_ key event that occurs!

## Named Handlers

For convenience, `useKeyPress` accepts a map of named handlers that
are called whenever the key press [state] matches the conditions
described by the given name.

### onKey

The `onKey` handler is equivalent to passing a handler function
directly to `useKeyPress`. In other words, this:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress({
  /** Do something with key press state */
  onKey(state) {},
});
```

is the same as this:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress(state => {
  /** Do something with key press state */
});
```

### onKeyPress

Often you only want to know if a key has been pressed.
For that, there is `onKeyPress`:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress({
  /**
   * Do something with key press state.
   * Note that this handler will only fire when a key is initially pressed!
   */
  onKeyPress(state) {},
});
```

You can think of `onKeyPress` as a convenience for handling
the _leading_ edge of a key press-hold-release sequence.

### onKeyRelease

Other times you only want to know if a key has been released.
For that, there is `onkeyRelease`:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress({
  /**
   * Do something with key press state.
   * Note that this handler will only fire when a key is released!
   */
  onKeyRelease(state) {},
});
```

You can think of `onKeyPress` as a convenience for handling
the _trailing_ edge of a press-hold-release sequence.

### Named Key Handlers

`useKeyPress` supports named handlers for commonly used keys.
These handlers are patterned after that more generic [onKey], [onKeyPress],
[onKeyRelease] handlers, but focused on just a single key. For example,
the handlers named `onArrowDown`, `onArrowDownPress`, and `onArrowDownRelease`
work just like their generic counterparts, except they only handle key events
that involve the `arrowdown` key.

Here is a list of supported named key handlers (`KeyPressHandler` is a function
that accepts key press [state]):

```ts
interface NamedHandlers {
  onArrowDown?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowDownPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowDownRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onArrowLeft?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowLeftPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowLeftRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onArrowRight?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowRightPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowRightRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onArrowUp?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowUpPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onArrowUpRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onEnd?: KeyPressHandler;
  onEndPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onEndRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onHome?: KeyPressHandler;
  onHomePress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onHomeRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onPageDown?: KeyPressHandler;
  onPageDownPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onPageDownRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onPageUp?: KeyPressHandler;
  onPageUpPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onPageUpRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onEscape?: KeyPressHandler;
  onEscapePress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onEscapeRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onEnter?: KeyPressHandler;
  onEnterPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onEnterRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onTab?: KeyPressHandler;
  onTabPress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onTabRelease?: KeyPressHandler;

  onSpace?: KeyPressHandler;
  onSpacePress?: KeyPressHandler;
  onSpaceRelease?: KeyPressHandler;
}
```

## State

Keyboard events come in two basic flavors, `keydown` and `keyup`, which
represent that a key has been pressed or released, respectively. In addition,
there are handful of variants of these events, such as:

- **repeat**: a `keydown` is automatically repeating.
- **shiftKey**: the `Shift` key is active
- **ctrlKey**: the `Ctrl` key is active
- **altKey**: the `Alt` (`Option` or `⌥` on OS X) key is active
- **metaKey**: the `Meta` (`Command` or `⌘` on OS X;
  `Windows` or `⊞` on Windows) key is active

These events and variants are reflected in the key handler state,
and any of them may be handled for any key with [handlers]:

```ts
interface KeyPressState {
  /** The event associated with the key press */
  event: React.KeyboardEvent | KeyboardEvent | null;
  /** A string representation of the key.  */
  key: string | null;
  /** Whether the key is pressed. */
  down: boolean;
  /** How many times the last event has repeated. */
  repeat: number;
  /** Whether the `Shift key is active. */
  shiftKey: boolean;
  /** Whether the `Ctrl` key is active */
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  /** Whether the `Alt` (`Option` or `⌥` on OS X) key is active */
  altKey: boolean;
  /** Whether the `Meta` (`Command` or `⌘` on OS X; */
  metaKey: boolean;
  /** Key press start time. */
  startTime: number;
  /** Key press elapsed time. */
  elapsedTime: number;
  /** Timestamp of the event. */
  timeStamp: number;
  /** Whether this is the first event. */
  first: boolean;
  /** Whether this is the last event. */
  last: boolean;
  /** Whether the key press is active. */
  active: boolean;
  /** Other active keys. */
  chord: string[];
}
```

## Config

`useKeyPress` accepts an optional configuration
for how to bind to keyboard events as a second argument:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress(handler, {
  /* options here */
});
```

The supported options are:

```ts
interface UseKeyPressConfig {
  /**
   * Whether or not key presses are enabled. Useful for toggling
   * keyboard behavior on or off.
   *
   * Default is `true`.
   */
  enabled?: boolean;
  /**
   * Optional config for the key event listener.
   * These options reflect the same DOM `addEventListener` options.
   */
  eventOptions?: {
    /** If `true`, keyboard events will be captured.*/
    capture?: boolean;
    /**
     * If `true`, the listener should not call `preventDefault()`.
     *
     * Note that this will have no effect if binding to a React element,
     * as ReactDOM events do not support passive listeners.
     * See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436
     */
    passive?: boolean;
  };
  /**
   * An optional target element or React ref. If defined,
   * the `bind()` function should be run as an effect,
   * not spread as props on a React component.
   */
  domTarget?: EventTarget | React.RefObject<EventTarget>;
}
```

## Bind

`useKeyPress` works by listening to keyboard events to keep track of
related sequences of keypresses (represented as [state]), and calling
[handlers] when necessary. In order for this to work, `useKeyPress` must
_bind_ to a source of keyboard events.

### Binding to a React Element

The default binding for `useKeyPress` is to any [React element]:

```ts
const bind = useKeyPress(handler, options);
// render a React element and bind `useKeyPress` handlers to it.
return <div {...bind()} />;
```

This works because `bind()` returns `onKeyDown` and `onKeyUp`
[React event handlers] as props.

### Binding to a DOM Element

`useKeyPress` also supports adding handlers to DOM nodes directly.
In this case, you shouldn't spread the `bind()` object as a prop,
but use it as a render effect via `useEffect`:

```ts
const ref = React.useRef(null);
const bind = useKeyPress(handler, {domTarget: ref});
// Run `bind` as an effect on mount, and anytime `bind` changes.
React.useEffect(bind, [bind]);
return <div ref={ref} />;
```
