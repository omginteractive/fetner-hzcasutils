# useRefCallback

A React [hook] for components that need to know when a [ref] changes.

> **NOTE** If your ref will contain a DOM node,
> you might not need this hook! React has [useLayoutEffect],
> which is usually the right place for code that depends on a DOM ref.

## What's it for?

React ships with a [useRef] hook that works perfectly fine for most
cases where a component needs a stable reference to a mutable value.
But sometimes, a component will have state or effects that
depend on the current value of the ref. In those cases,
it is not enough to add the ref or it's current value
as dependencies of the effect:

```js
const SomeComponent = () => {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(
    () => {
      if (ref.current) {
        // do something with the current ref.
      }
    },
    // We might think to specify that this effect depends on the ref,
    // but this won't work, because:
    // 1) `ref` is stable between renders (and will never change), and
    // 2) `ref.current` is mutable, and react won't rerender when it changes.
    [ref, ref.current],
  );
  return <div ref={ref} />;
};
```

This hook aims to address this use case by providing a [callback ref]
that can be used instead of the standard [ref object].
When the callback ref is called (i.e., by React after render),
the hook will trigger a rerender of the component, giving it a chance
to work with the updated ref value.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/use-ref-callback
```

## Usage

```js
import useRefCallback from '@hzdg/use-ref-callback';

const SomeComponent = () => {
  // Returns a tuple of a ref object and a ref callback.
  // An optional initial value is allowed and works just like `React.useRef`.
  const [ref, setRef] = useRefCallback(null);
  useEffect(
    () => {
      if (ref.current) {
        // do something with the current ref.
      }
    },
    // Note that `ref.current` is mutable, and react won't rerender
    // when it changes, but unlike in the example above,
    // this _will_ work, because we have a `setRef` callback to call
    // whenever the ref changes, which will trigger a rerender.
    // Note also that we can omit `ref` from the list, as `ref`
    // is ref object (like you would get from `useRef`),
    // and is stable between renders.
    [ref.current],
  );
  // Notice we pass `setRef` rather than `ref` here.
  // React will call `setRef` with the current value on render.
  // If we wanted to use our ref to store something other than
  // React elements, we could use `setRef(valueToStore)` ourselves.
  return <div ref={setRef} />;
};
```

## Usage with Ref Forwarding

Sometimes a component needs to [forward a ref] to its children.
To support this case, `useRefCallback` accepts an optional ref argument:

```js
const SomeRefForwardingComponent = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  // We pass `forwardedRef` (which may be a ref object or a callack ref)
  // to `useRefCallback`. Note that the returned `ref` will _not_ be
  // the same as `forwardedRef`, but they _will_ get the same value
  // from calls to `setRef`.
  const [ref, setRef] = useRefCallback(null, forwardedRef);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (ref.current) {
      // do something with the current ref.
    }
  }, [ref.current]);
  return <div ref={setRef} />;
});
```
