# useNearestScrollNodeRef

A React [hook] for finding the nearest scrollable ancestor of a DOM node.

> **Note:**
> This hook is quite low-level in nature. You may want to explore
> other scroll-related hooks like [useScrolling], [useScrollDirection],
> [useScrollPosition], [useIntersection], or [useScrollIntersection].

### Wait, what's a 'scrollable node'?

A 'scrollable node' is a DOM node that has a computed [overflow] value
of `scroll`, or the root ([document]) element.

In other words a 'scrollable node' is a container that
has scrollbars for its content.

### Ok, but what's this _for_?

Sometimes a component needs to know about details about scroll position,
direction, or intersection. This hook makes it easy to find the
scrollable ancestor that is responsible for those details.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/scroll-monitor
```

## Usage

```ts
import {useNearestScrollNodeRef} from '@hzdg/scroll-monitor';

function useNearestScrollNodeRef<T extends Node>(
  ref: React.RefObject<T>,
): React.RefObject<HTMLElement | Document | null>;
```

Takes a [ref object] that referenceas a DOM node, or `null`.
`useNearestScrollNodeRef` will traverse the DOM to find
the nearest scrollable parent node.

The returned [ref object] will reference the nearest scrollable node,
or `null`.
