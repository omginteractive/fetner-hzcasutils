# useScrollIntersection

A React [hook] for components that care about
the intersection of the nearest scrollable container's scroll position
with one or more areas of the scrollable area.

> **Note:**
> If your use case is for knowing when an element intersects with the viewport
> or a scrollable area, or any other use case that could be covered
> by [IntersectionObserver], you should try [useIntersection] instead.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/scroll-monitor
```

## Usage

```js
import {useScrollIntersection} from '@hzdg/scroll-monitor';
```

`useScrollIntersection` supports using an existing [ref object].
(See [shared ref / ref forwarding] for more).

This means `useScrollIntersection` has 2 different signatures:

Without an existing [ref object]:

```ts
function useScrollIntersection(
  config: ScrollIntersectionConfig,
): [Intersects, (node: HTMLElement | null) => void];
```

The returned [callback ref] should be passed to an underlying DOM node.

With an existing [ref object]:

```ts
function useScrollIntersection(
  providedRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  config: ScrollIntersectionConfig,
): Intersects;
```

Note that `useScrollIntersection` will _not_ return a [callback ref] in
this case. The provided [ref object] is expected to be passed to an
underlying DOM node.

> **Note:** Using an existing ref object has some possible gotchas.
>
> See [Shared Ref / Ref Forwarding] for more.

## Config

`config: BoundsRect | BoundsRect[]`

One or more areas to check for intersection with
the nearest scrollable container's scroll position.

A `BoundsRect` area can be defined completely, i.e.,

`{top: 0, right: 50, bottom: 50, left: 0}`

or partially, i.e.,

`{right: 50, bottom: 50}`

## State

If a `providedRef` is passed to `useScrollIntersection`,
returns the `Intersects` value, consisting of one intersection
boolean or an array of booleans.

If no `providedRef` is passed, returns an array containing an `Intersects` value
and a callback `ref`. The `ref` should be passed to an underlying DOM node.
Note that the node does not have to be scrollable itself,
as `useScrollIntersection` will traverse the DOM to find
a scrollable parent to observe.

`Intersects` describes whether or not any of the configured areas
currently intersect with the nearest scrollable container's scroll position.

If a single area has been configured, `Intersects` will be a boolean.
If an array of areas has been configured, this will be an array of booleans,
where the index of each boolean corresponds to the index of the area in
the configuration array.

### Intersects

```ts
type Intersects = boolean | boolean[];
```

## Example

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const IntersectionIndicator = ({intersects}) => (
      <div
        style={{
          display: 'flex',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          width: '100%',
          height: 250,
          fontSize: '2em',
          color: `${intersects ? 'white' : 'yellow'}`,
          background: `${intersects ? 'green' : 'red'}`,
        }}
      >
        {intersects ? 'intersecting' : 'not intersecting'}
      </div>
    );
    const ScrollIntersectionUser = () => {
      const [intersects, ref] = useScrollIntersection([
        {bottom: 250},
        {top: 250},
        {top: 500},
      ]);
      return (
        <div ref={ref} style={{overflow: 'scroll', width: '100%', height: 250}}>
          <IntersectionIndicator intersects={intersects[0]} />
          <IntersectionIndicator intersects={intersects[1]} />
          <IntersectionIndicator intersects={intersects[2]} />
        </div>
      );
    };
    return <ScrollIntersectionUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

## Shared Ref / Ref Forwarding

> **Note:** Using an existing ref object has a possible gotcha:
> `useScrollIntersection` cannot know when the current value has changed!
> This means the component is responsible for rerendering
> whenever the the ref's value has been changed.
> One easy way to achieve this is with [useRefCallback].

Sometimes a component needs to [forward a ref] to its children,
or [use a ref][useref] with other hooks.
To support these cases, `useScrollIntersection`
accepts an optional `providedRef` [ref object]:

```js
const SomeRefForwardingComponent = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  // We pass `forwardedRef` (which _must_ be a ref object)
  // via the `ref` option to `useScrollIntersection`.
  // Note that a callback ref will _not_ be returned.
  // Note also that `useScrollIntersection` won't be notified if the ref's
  // current value has changed, so it is up to this component
  // (or a parent component) to rerender whenever that happens.
  // In this example, we `useRefCallback` to solve this.
  const intersects = useScrollIntersection(forwardedRef, {top: 250});
  const [, setRef] = useRefCallback(null, forwardedRef);
  return <div ref={setRef}>{JSON.stringify(intersects, null, 2)}</div>;
});
```

or, with `useRef`:

```js
const SomeRefUsingComponent = () => {
  // Create our own ref to use.
  const ref = React.useRef(null);
  // We pass our own ref via the `ref` option to `useScrollIntersection`.
  // Note that a callback ref will _not_ be returned.
  // Note also that `useScrollIntersection` won't be notified if the ref's
  // current value has changed, so it is up to this component
  // to rerender whenever that happens. In this example,
  // we `useRefCallback` to solve this.
  const intersects = useScrollIntersection(ref, {top: 250});
  const [, setRef] = useRefCallback(null, ref);
  return <div ref={setRef}>{JSON.stringify(intersects, null, 2)}</div>;
};
```
