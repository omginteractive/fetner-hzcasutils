# ScrollMonitor

A React [component] for monitoring and interacting with scroll position.

`ScrollMonitor` is a [headless component], meaning
it accepts a child [render prop], and returns the result
of calling that render prop with the latest state of
the nearest scrollable container.

> **Deprecated**
>
> It is generally better to use the [hooks]
> that provide the specific aspects of scrolling you would like to
> monitor, rather than use this component. To read more about them, see:

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/scroll-monitor
```

## Usage

```
import ScrollMonitor from '@hzdg/scroll-monitor';
```

## Example

<Playground>
  <ScrollMonitor scrolling direction position>
    {state => (
      <pre ref={state.scrollRef} style={{width: '100%', height: 250}}>
        {JSON.stringify(
          Object.assign({}, state, {scrollRef: undefined}),
          null,
          2,
        )}
      </pre>
    )}
  </ScrollMonitor>
</Playground>

## Props

### children

```ts
children: (state: ScrollMonitorRenderProps) => JSX.Element;
```

A function that takes [scroll state] and returns a React element.
Also known as a 'render prop'.

### innerRef

```ts
innerRef?: React.Ref<HTMLElement> | null;
```

An optional [ref object] or [callback ref].
Useful when the owner component needs to handle ref forwarding.

### direction

```ts
direction?: boolean | null;
```

Whether or not to monitor scroll direction.

If `true`, then [scroll state] will have a `direction` value
like `{vertical: 'down', horizontal: 'right'}`.

### position

```ts
position?: boolean | null;
```

Whether or not to monitor scroll position.

If `true`, then [scroll state] will have a `position` value
like `{top: 10, left: 10}`.

### scrolling

```ts
scrolling?: boolean | null;
```

Whether or not to monitor scrolling state.

if `true`, then [scroll state] will have a boolean `scrolling` value
where `true` means scrolling is happening.

### intersects

```ts
intersects?: ScrollIntersectionConfig | null;
```

One area, or array of areas, of the form
`{top?: number, right?: number, bottom?: number, left?: number}`
within a scrollable area to monitor for intersection with scroll position.

If defined, then [scroll state] will have an `intersects` value
like `true` or `[true, false]`, depending on if the config defines
a single area an array of areas. The value indicates whether or not
scroll position currently intersects with the defined area.

### onStart

```ts
onStart?: (() => void) | null;
```

A callback for when scrolling starts.

### onChange

```ts
onChange?: ((state: ScrollMonitorRenderProps) => void) | null;
```

A callback for when scroll position changes.
Receives the latest [scroll state], in the same form as the render prop.

### onEnd

```ts
onEnd?: (() => void) | null;
```

A callback for when scrolling stops.

## Render Props

A Scroll state object passed to the ScrollMonitor render prop (children function).

In usage as follows:

```js
<ScrollMonitor {...props}>
  {(state) => (...)}
</ScrollMonitor>
```

The value of `state` will include some or all of the following:

### state.scrollRef

```ts
 scrollRef: (instance: HTMLElement | null) => void;
```

A [callback ref] that should be passed to an underlying DOM node.
Note that the node does not have to be scrollable itself,
as `ScrollMonitor` will traverse the DOM to find a scrollable parent
to observe.

### state.scrolling

```ts
 scrolling?: boolean;
```

Whether or not the nearest scrollable container is currently scrolling.

Only set if the [scrolling](#scrolling) prop is `true`,
or if any of the [onStart](#onstart), [onChange](#onchange), or [onEnd](#onend)
callbacks are defined.

### state.position

```ts
 position?: ScrollPosition;
```

The current position of the nearest scrollable container.

Only set if the [position](#position) prop is `true`,
or if the [onChange](#onchange) callback is defined.

### state.direction

```ts
 direction?: ScrollDirection;
```

The latest vertical and horizontal direction of scroll
in the nearest scrollable container.

Only set if the [direction](#direction) prop is `true`.

### state.intersects

```ts
 intersects?: Intersects;
```

Whether or not the latest position of the nearest scrollable container
intersects with one or more defined areas.

Only set if the [intersects](#intersects) prop
is given a defined area, or array of areas, of the form
`{top?: number, right?: number, bottom?: number, left?: number}`.

## Usage with Ref Forwarding

Sometimes a component needs to [forward a ref] to its children.
To support this case, `ScrollMonitor` accepts an optional `innerRef` prop:

```js
const RefForwardingScrollMonitor = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  // We pass `forwardedRef` (which may be a ref object or a callack ref)
  // to `ScrollMonitor`. Note that the returned `scrollRef` render prop
  // will _not_ be the same as `forwardedRef`, but they _will_ get
  // the same value.
  return (
    <ScrollMonitor {...props} innerRef={forwardedRef}>
      {/*
        Note that we actually pass `scrollRef` to the underlying component,
        not `forwardedRef`. We do this to make sure that
        `ScrollMonitor` is notified when the ref value changes.
        This works because we passed `forwardedRef` to `ScrollMonitor`,
        which will update the `forwardedRef` automatically.
      */}
      {({scrollRef, ...state}) => <div ref={scrollRef}>{/* ... */}</div>}
    </ScrollMonitor>
  );
});
```
