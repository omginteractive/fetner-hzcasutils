# GestureCatcher

A React [component] that can detect gestures from mouse, touch, or keyboard inputs.
This is useful for custom UI like carousels, screen navigations,
or custom scrolling.

> **Note**: If your use case is related to scrolling,
> but doesn't need to control scroll position,
> then [ScrollMonitor] provides a simpler approach.

`GestureCatcher` is a [headless component], meaning
it accepts a child [render prop], and returns the result
of calling that render prop with the latest state of
an ongoing or completed gesture.

> **Deprecated**
>
> It is generally better to use the [hooks]
> that provide the specific types of gesture input you would like to
> detect, rather than use this component. To read more about them, see:

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/gesture-catcher
```

## Usage

```
import GestureCatcher from '@hzdg/gesture-catcher';
```

## Examples

A basic example that shows off all possible gesture inputs
(try using mouse, wheel/touchpad, touch, keyboard):

<Playground>
  <GestureCatcher preventDefault>
    {state => (
      <pre
        tabIndex={1}
        ref={state.gestureRef}
        style={{width: '100%', minHeight: 400}}
      >
        {JSON.stringify(Object.assign({}, state, {gestureRef: null}), null, 2)}
      </pre>
    )}
  </GestureCatcher>
</Playground>

An example that uses gesture inputs with custom configurations:

<Playground>
  <GestureCatcher wheel={{threshold: 100}} keyboard={{preventDefault: true}}>
    {state => (
      <pre
        tabIndex={1}
        ref={state.gestureRef}
        style={{width: '100%', minHeight: 400}}
      >
        {JSON.stringify(Object.assign({}, state, {gestureRef: null}), null, 2)}
      </pre>
    )}
  </GestureCatcher>
</Playground>

## Props

### children

```ts
children: (state: GestureCatcherRenderProps) => JSX.Element;
```

A function that takes [gesture state] and returns a React element.
Also known as a 'render prop'.

### innerRef

```ts
innerRef?: React.Ref<HTMLElement> | null;
```

An optional ref object or callback ref.
Useful when the owner component needs to handle ref forwarding.

### disabled

```ts
disabled?: boolean | null;
```

Whether or not gesture detection is enabled.

### passive

```ts
passive?: boolean | null;
```

Whether or not to listen to gesture events passively.
If `true`, then `preventDefault` will have no effect.

### preventDefault

```ts
preventDefault?: boolean | null;
```

Whether or not to prevent the default action
for events during a gesture.

### keyboard

```ts
keyboard?: KeyboardGestureConfig | boolean | null;
```

Either a boolean determining whether or not to detect keyboard gestures,
or configuration for detecting keyboard gestures. This configuration
inherits `passive` and `preventDefault` props.

### mouse

```ts
mouse?: MouseGestureConfig | boolean | null;
```

Either a boolean determining whether or not to detect mouse gestures,
or configuration for detecting mouse gestures. This configuration
inherits `passive` and `preventDefault` props.

### touch

```ts
touch?: TouchGestureConfig | boolean | null;
```

Either a boolean determining whether or not to detect touch gestures,
or configuration for detecting touch gestures. This configuration
inherits `passive` and `preventDefault` props.

### wheel

```ts
wheel?: WheelGestureConfig | boolean | null;
```

Either a boolean determining whether or not to detect wheel gestures,
or configuration for detecting wheel gestures. This configuration
inherits `passive` and `preventDefault` props.

### onStart

```ts
onStart?: ((state: GestureState) => void) | null;
```

A callback for when gesturing starts.
Receives the initializing gesture state.

### onMove

```ts
onMove?: ((state: GestureState) => void) | null;
```

A callback for when an ongoing gesture updates.
Receives the latest gesture state.

### onEnd

```ts
onEnd?: ((state: GestureEndState) => void) | null;
```

A callback for when a gesture has completed.
Receives the ending gesture state.

## Render Props

A gesture state object passed to the GestureCatcher
render prop (children function).

In usage as follows:

```js
<GestureCatcher {...props}>
  {(state) => (...)}
</GestureCatcher>
```

### gestureRef

```ts
gestureRef: (node: HTMLElement | null) => void;
```

A callback ref that should be passed to an underlying DOM node.

### Gesture State

The latest gesture state will also be part of the render props.

For more on gesture state, see:

- [KeyboardGestureState]
- [KeyboardGestureEndState]
- [MouseGestureState]
- [MouseGestureEndState]
- [TouchGestureState]
- [TouchGestureEndState]
- [WheelGestureState]
- [WheelGestureEndState]

## Usage with Ref Forwarding

Sometimes a component needs to [forward a ref] to its children.
To support this case, `GestureCatcher` accepts an optional `innerRef` prop:

```js
const RefForwardingGestureCatcher = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  // We pass `forwardedRef` (which may be a ref object or a callack ref)
  // to `GestureCatcher`. Note that the returned `gestureRef` render prop
  // will _not_ be the same as `forwardedRef`, but they _will_ get
  // the same value.
  return (
    <GestureCatcher {...props} innerRef={forwardedRef}>
      {/*
        Note that we actually pass `gestureRef` to the underlying component,
        not `forwardedRef`. We do this to make sure that
        `GestureCatcher` is notified when the ref value changes.
        This works because we passed `forwardedRef` to `GestureCatcher`,
        which will update the `forwardedRef` automatically.
      */}
      {({gestureRef, ...state}) => <div ref={gestureRef}>{/* ... */}</div>}
    </GestureCatcher>
  );
});
```
