# useKeyboardGesture

A React [hook] for components that want to handle keyboard gesture intent.

<KeyboardGestureVisualizer>
  <p style={{color: 'lightgray'}}>Use arrow keys, spacebar, home, end, pgup, pgdown to gesture!</p>
  <p style={{color: 'lightgray'}}>Click to reset</p>
</KeyboardGestureVisualizer>

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/gesture-catcher
```

## Usage

```js
import {useKeyboardGesture} from '@hzdg/gesture-catcher';
```

`useKeyboardGesture` supports using an existing [ref object].
(See [shared ref / ref forwarding] for more).

This means `useKeyboardGesture` has 2 different signatures:

Without an existing [ref object]:

```ts
function useKeyboardGesture(
  handler: KeyboardGestureChangeHandler | KeyboardGestureHandlers,
  config?: KeyboardGestureConfig | null,
): (node: HTMLElement | null) => void;
```

The returned [callback ref] should be passed to an underlying DOM node.

With an existing [ref object]:

```ts
function useKeyboardGesture(
  providedRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  handler: KeyboardGestureChangeHandler | KeyboardGestureHandlers,
  config?: KeyboardGestureConfig | null,
): void;
```

Note that `useKeyboardGesture` will _not_ return a [callback ref] in this case.
The provided [ref object] is expected to be passed to an underlying DOM node.

## Config

`config?: KeyboardGestureConfig | null`

An object describing configuration for observing keyboard gestures.
This is optionally provided to [useKeyboardGesture].

```ts
interface KeyboardGestureConfig {
  /**
   * Whether or not to prevent the default action
   * for `keydown` and `keyup` events during a gesture.
   */
  preventDefault: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether or not to listen to keyboard events passively.
   * If `true`, then `preventDefault` will have no effect.
   */
  passive: boolean;
}
```

## Handler

`handler: KeyboardGestureChangeHandler | KeyboardGestureHandlers`

A function to handle keyboard gesture updates, or a configuration of handlers,
like `{onStart?, onMove?, onEnd?}`.

See [KeyboardGestureChangeHandler], [KeyboardGestureHandlers],
[KeyboardGestureState], and [KeyboardGestureEndState] for more.

### KeyboardGestureChangeHandler

A function that handles changes to an ongoing or finished keyboard gesture.
Receives [KeyboardGestureState] or [KeyboardGestureEndState] objects.

```ts
type KeyboardGestureChangeHandler = (
  state: KeyboardGestureState | KeyboardGestureEndState,
) => void;
```

### KeyboardGestureHandlers

An object with optional `onStart`, `onMove`, and/or `onEnd` methods.
If defined, `onStart` and `onMove` will recieve [KeyboardGestureState] objects,
while `onEnd` will receive [KeyboardGestureEndState] objects.

```ts
interface KeyboardGestureHandlers {
  onStart?: (state: KeyboardGestureState) => void;
  onMove?: (state: KeyboardGestureState) => void;
  onEnd?: (state: KeyboardGestureEndState) => void;
}
```

## State

`state: KeyboardGestureState | KeyboardGestureEndState`

An object describing the state of an ongoing or finished keyboard gesture.
This is provided to the [handler] or handlers.

### KeyboardGestureState

An object describing the latest state of an ongoing keyboard gesture.

It is passed to the [KeyboardGestureChangeHandler]
or `onStart` and `onMove` [KeyboardGestureHandlers] provided to [useKeyboardGesture].

```ts
interface KeyboardGestureState {
  /** The latest x position for the gesture. */
  x: number;
  /** The latest y position for the gesture. */
  y: number;
  /** The cumulative change of the gesture in the x dimension. */
  xDelta: number;
  /** The cumulative change of the gesture in the y dimension. */
  yDelta: number;
  /** The initial x position for the gesture. */
  xInitial: number;
  /** The initial y position for the gesture. */
  yInitial: number;
  /** The previous x position for the gesture. */
  xPrev: number;
  /** The previous y position for the gesture. */
  yPrev: number;
  /** The latest velocity of the gesture in the x dimension. */
  xVelocity: number;
  /** The latest velocity of the gesture in the y dimension. */
  yVelocity: number;
  /** Whether or not the key that triggered the gesture is repeating. */
  repeat: boolean | null;
  /** The key that triggered the gesture. */
  key:
    | 'Space'
    | 'PageUp'
    | 'PageDown'
    | 'End'
    | 'Home'
    | 'ArrowLeft'
    | 'ArrowUp'
    | 'ArrowRight'
    | 'ArrowDown';
  /** Indicates a gesture is ongoing. */
  gesturing: true;
  /** The type of event associated with the gesture. */
  type: 'keydown';
}
```

### KeyboardGestureEndState

An object describing the last state of a previous keyboard gesture.

It is passed to the [KeyboardGestureChangeHandler]
or `onEnd` [KeyboardGestureHandlers] provided to [useKeyboardGesture].

```ts
interface KeyboardGestureEndState extends KeyboardGestureState {
  /** Indicates a gesture is complete */
  gesturing: false;
  /** The type of event associated with the end of the gesture. */
  type: 'keyup';
}
```

## Example

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const KeyboardGestureUser = () => {
      const [gesture, setGesture] = React.useState('try arrow keys!');
      const config = React.useMemo(() => ({preventDefault: true}), []);
      const ref = useKeyboardGesture(setGesture, config);
      return (
        <div
          ref={ref}
          style={{
            display: 'flex',
            justifyContent: 'center',
            alignItems: 'center',
            width: '100%',
            height: 250,
            fontSize: '2em',
          }}
        >
          {JSON.stringify(gesture, null, 2)}
        </div>
      );
    };
    return <KeyboardGestureUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

## Shared Ref / Ref Forwarding

> **Note:** Using an existing ref object has a possible gotcha:
> `useKeyboardGesture` cannot know when the current value has changed!
> This means the component is responsible for rerendering
> whenever the the ref's value has been changed.
> One easy way to achieve this is with [useRefCallback].
> See the existing ref examples above for more.

Sometimes a component needs to [forward a ref] to its children,
or [use a ref][useref] with other hooks.
To support these cases, `useKeyboardGesture` accepts an optional [ref object].

It could be used with ref forwarding like:

```js
const SomeRefForwardingComponent = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  const [gesture, setGesture] = React.useState(null);
  // We pass `forwardedRef` (which _must_ be a ref object)
  // via the `ref` option to `useKeyboardGesture`.
  // Note that a callback ref will _not_ be returned.
  // Note also that `useKeyboardGesture` won't be notified if the ref's
  // current value has changed, so it is up to this component
  // (or a parent component) to rerender whenever that happens.
  // In this example, we `useRefCallback` to solve this.
  useKeyboardGesture(forwardedRef, setGesture);
  const [, setRef] = useRefCallback(null, forwardedRef);
  return <div ref={setRef}>{JSON.stringify(gesture, null, 2)}</div>;
});
```

or, with `useRef`:

```js
const SomeRefUsingComponent = () => {
  const [gesture, setGesture] = React.useState(null);
  // Create our own ref to use.
  const ref = React.useRef(null);
  // We pass our own ref via the `ref` option to `useKeyboardGesture`.
  // Note that a callback ref will _not_ be returned.
  // Note also that `useKeyboardGesture` won't be notified if the ref's
  // current value has changed, so it is up to this component
  // to rerender whenever that happens. In this example,
  // we `useRefCallback` to solve this.
  useKeyboardGesture(ref, setGesture);
  const [, setRef] = useRefCallback(null, ref);
  return <div ref={setRef}>{JSON.stringify(gesture, null, 2)}</div>;
};
```
