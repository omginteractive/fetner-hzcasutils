# MovingAverage

`MovingAverage` is a simple utility for keeping an average
of the latest fixed number of values over time. It is a simplistic
implementation of a statistical [moving average].

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/moving-average
```

## Usage

```js
import MovingAverage from '@hzdg/moving-average';

const x = new MovingAverage({size: 6, weight: 1});
const y = new MovingAverage({size: 6, weight: 1});
const t = new MovingAverage({size: 12, round: true});
let lastTimeStamp;

document.addEventListener('mousemove', e => {
  x.push(e.movementX);
  y.push(e.movementY);
  if (lastTimeStamp) t.push(e.timeStamp - lastTimeStamp);
  lastTimeStamp = e.timeStamp;

  console.log('x movement          ', x.peek());
  console.log('x movement average  ', x.value);
  console.log('x movement deviation', x.deviation);
  console.log('x movement delta    ', x.delta);

  console.log('y movement          ', x.peek());
  console.log('y movement average  ', x.value);
  console.log('y movement deviation', x.deviation);
  console.log('y movement delta    ', x.delta);

  console.log('duration          ', x.peek());
  console.log('duration average  ', x.value);
  console.log('duration deviation', x.deviation);
  console.log('duration delta    ', x.delta);
});
```

## Options

```ts
interface MovingAverageOptions {
  size?: number;
  weight?: number;
  round?: boolean;
}
```

### size

Defaults to `10`.

How many previous values to include in the calculation of the average.
Once the number of values starts to exceed `size`, older values
are dropped from the calculation. This is what makes the average 'move'.

### weight

Defaults to `1`.

How much weight to give to the latest value.
This weight regresses linearly over `size` number of values,
such that the latest value has the most weight, and the oldest
value the least.

Use a negative value to give the oldest value the most weight instead.

Use a falsy value to give all values equal weight.

### round

Defaults to `false`.

Whether or not the moving average is rounded to the nearest integer.

## Methods

### constructor

```ts
const movingAverage = new MovingAverage(options?: MovingAverageOptions);
```

### slice

```ts
slice(start?: number, end?: number): MovingAverage
```

Returns a portion of the stored values in this `MovingAverage`
as a new `MovingAverage`. The new `MovingAverage` will inherit the
configuration of this `MovingAverage`, with the exception of `size`.
The size of the new `MovingAverage` will be determined by `end - start`,
where `end` defaults to the size of the originating `MovingAverage`,
and `start` defaults to `0`.

### push

```ts
push(v: number): void
```

Add a value to the moving average.

### reset

```ts
reset(): void
```

Reset the moving average.
Use this when your value is tied to discrete start and end events,
like a gesture.

### valueOf

```ts
valueOf(): number
```

The moving average of the value since the last reset.
This average is based on the last `size` number of values,
and may be optionally weighted and rounded.

## Getters

### deviation

```ts
get deviation(): number
```

The absolute deviation of the last value from the moving average.

### delta

```ts
get delta(): number
```

The cumulative change (from 0) of the value since the last reset.

### rolling

```ts
get rolling(): boolean
```

Whether or not the average is rolling. The average starts rolling
once the number of items added to the average meets or exceeds the size.

### value

```ts
get value(): number
```

The moving average of the value since the last reset.
This average is based on the last `size` number of values,
and may be optionally weighted and rounded.
