# useDebouncedCallback

A React [hook] for components that want to [debounce] a callback.

<DebounceVisualizer />

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzdg/use-debounced-callback
```

## Usage

```js
import useDebouncedCallback from '@hzdg/use-debounced-callback';
```

The most basic use case is to create a [memoized] callback that
is debounced by some delay (in `ms`):

```js
function SomeComponent() {
  const handleMouseMove = useDebouncedCallback(event => {
    // Do something with `event`, but only after 200ms
    // have passed since the last move event!
  }, 200);
  return <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>hello, mouse moves!</div>;
}
```

> **Note:** When you omit the dependency list to `useDebouncedCallback`,
> you get a memoized callback like you would get from [useCallback]
> with the callback as its own dependency.
> That is, it is equivalent to `useCallback(callback, [callback])`.
> This means that the memoized callback will change whenever the **provided**
> callback changes. In this example, it would change on **every render**.

However, often times you will want to affect some state or otherwise
incorporate some dependencies in your callback, in which case you can
provide a dependency array (just like [useCallback]):

```js
function SomeComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(/*...*/);
  const handleMouseMove = useDebouncedCallback(
    event => {
      // Do something with `event` and `state`,
      // but only after 200ms have passed since the last move event!
    },
    200,
    [state],
  );
  return <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>hello, mouse moves!</div>;
}
```

> **Note:** With a dependency array provided, the memoized callback will
> only change when the dependencies change (like [useCallback]), **or**
> the debounce config changes. In this example, the memoized callback
> will only change if the timeout is changed (to a value different from `200`),
> or if `state` changes.

## Options

The `useDebouncedCallback` API is directly inspired by [lodash debounce],
which means it supports a number of [options] that can modify the behavior
of the debounced callback.

```ts
type UseDebouncedCallbackOptions =
  | number
  | {
      wait?: number;
      maxWait?: number;
      leading?: boolean;
      trailing?: boolean;
    };
```

`useDebouncedCallback` supports a numeric timeout option, or an options object.
If an object is provided, the [wait] option is equivalent to a numeric timeout:

```js
// These are the equivalent configurations.
useDebouncedCallback(() => {}, 200, []);
useDebouncedCallback(() => {}, {wait: 200}, []);
```

In addition to [wait], there are also [maxWait], [leading],
and [trailing] options.

### Wait

Defaults to `0`.

The amount of time (in ms) to wait
before allowing the callback to be invoked.

### MaxWait

Optional.

The maximum amount of time (in ms) to wait
before allowing the callback to be invoked.

### Leading

Defaults to `false`.

Invoke the callback before debouncing.

If `false` while [wait] is `0`, behaves similarly
to calling the callback with `setTimeout(callback, 0)`.

### Trailing

Defaults to `true`.

Invoke the callback after debouncing.

If `true` while [leading] is `true`, the trailing invocation
is only scheduled if the callback is called more than once
while invocation is debounced.

## Imperative Methods

`useDebouncedCallback` returns a memoized function that includes [cancel] and
[flush] 'escape hatch' methods for managing debounced invocation lifecycles:

```ts
interface Debounced<T extends (...args: any[]) => any> {
  (...args: Parameters<T>): ReturnType<T> | undefined;
  /** Cancel the next scheduled invocation of the callback. */
  cancel(): void;
  /** Force the next invocation of the callback to occur immediately. */
  flush(): void;
}
```

### Cancel

The `cancel` method will prevent a scheduled invocation of the
underlying callback from ocurring:

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const handleMouseMove = useDebouncedCallback(
    event => {
      // We do something with event here after 200ms of no mouse moves.
    },
    200,
    [],
  );

  useEffect(
    () => () => {
      // But we want to cancel handling a pending mouse move
      // when our component has unmounted.
      handleMouseMove.cancel();
    },
    [handleMouseMove],
  );

  return <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>...</div>;
}
```

> **Note:** If there is no debounced invocation scheduled, `cancel()` is a no-op.

### Flush

The `flush` method will _immediately_ invoke a scheduled invocation of
the underlying callback:

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const handleMouseMove = useDebouncedCallback(
    event => {
      // We do something with event here after 200ms of no mouse moves.
    },
    200,
    [],
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    // But we also handle a pending mouse move as an effect of rerendering.
    handleMouseMove.flush();
  });

  return <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>...</div>;
}
```

> **Note:** If there is no debounced invocation scheduled, `flush()` is a no-op.
